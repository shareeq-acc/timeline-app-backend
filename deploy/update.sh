# **Why the server pulls instead of GitHub pushing.** The firewall denies
# inbound except 80, 443 and the tailnet, and GitHub's runners are on none of
# those. The alternatives are opening SSH to the internet or joining every CI
# run to the tailnet with a long-lived key; both hand a deploy credential to a
# third party to save a couple of minutes. This needs no inbound access, no
# secret in GitHub, and it heals itself: a box that was down for a day catches
# up on its next tick without anyone re-running a pipeline.

# Idempotent, safe to run as often as you like, and quiet when there is
# nothing to do — which matters, because it runs every few minutes forever.
