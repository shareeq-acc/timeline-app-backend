# inbound except 80, 443 and the tailnet, and GitHub's runners are on none of

# run to the tailnet with a long-lived key; both hand a deploy credential to a
# third party to save a couple of minutes. This needs no inbound access, no
# secret in GitHub, and it heals itself: a box that was down for a day catches
